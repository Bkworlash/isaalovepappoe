            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-4">Founder/President of Isaac love Pappoe (ILP) Ministries. He is a seasoned and passionate son of God with the dynamic capacity to operate in all the ministry and spiritual gifts when the need arises. He is a product of the University of Professional Studies, Accra, and holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing. He is an anointed and highly gifted minister of the Gospel of God’s grace and specializes as a prophet, teacher, minister of the finished work of Christ and an author of many books, including ‘If These Things Be in You’, ‘Christ, The Mystery Behind The Hebrew Names’ and ‘Grace Syrup’.
<br>	Currently Pastoring the Love and Grace Fellowship of the United Christian Ministries International, Minister Pappoe is a frequent and highly sought-after speaker at revivals, seminars and conferences. His strongest convictions and inclinations are exemplified in the radical passion he possesses, aimed at enlightening the understanding of men regarding their participation in the mystery that was hidden from the ages past and has now been revealed concerning the death, burial, resurrection, ascension and seating of Jesus Christ; this he believes is the missing link in the Gospel being preached; hence, the inefficacy of its power thereof.<br><br><strong><em>&nbsp;BELIEVE</em></strong><br>&nbsp;In one God, who exists in three Persons—the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He is loving, holy and just.<br>That the Bible is God’s Word. It is inspired and accurate. It is our perfect guide in all matters of life.<br>That sin has separated us all from God, and that only through Jesus Christ can we be reconciled to God.<br>That Jesus Christ is both God and Man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He led a sinless life, took all our sins upon Himself, died and rose again. Today, He is seated at the right hand of the Father as our High Priest and Mediator.<br>That salvation is the gift of God to man. This gift is effected by grace through faith in Jesus Christ and it results in works pleasing to God.<br>That water baptism is a symbol of the cleansing power of God and a testimony of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>That the Holy Spirit is our Comforter. He guides us in all areas of our lives. He also blesses us with spiritual gifts and empowers us to yield the fruit of the Spirit.<br>That the Holy Communion is a celebration of Jesus’ death and our remembrance of Him.<br>That God wants to transform, heal and provide for us, so that we can live blessed and victorious lives that will impact and help others.<br>That we are called to preach the gospel to all nations.<br>That our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back again just as He promised.<br></p>
